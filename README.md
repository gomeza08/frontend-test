This is a quick backbonejs web page that reads data from the placester data in listings.json and displays it on the page. If you
navigate to the root of this directory and excute "npm install" from the command line, then "node server.js", and navigate to
"http://localhost:8080/" you will come to a basic page displaying links to all the properties on the placester api for the given 
api key. The only issue I've found is that the content takes a second to refresh on page chagnes.

I timeboxed myself into 4 hours to complete this, and spent and additional hour for the extra fixes
